# SerialManager
A process that that runs in the background to handle the sending and receiving of USB data between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. Build to be independent of it's consumers, SerialManager uses a ReDis publish-subscribe structure so that any other process may request to send data.

This process was originally from a Mississippi State CSE Senior Project.
